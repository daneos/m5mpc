MPD client for Maemo 5 platform

-

In order to build, you need to have Maemo SDK installed.  
I've followed instructions here: http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo_5_Final_SDK_Installation  
You also have to install libmpdclient-dev from extras-devel.  
  
Currently there is only very clumsy text interface, but it's mainly designed for testing the MPDClient class, that interfaces with MPD. The goal is to provide GUI based on Hildon.
